# rubyrays

This is a Ruby port of [the business card raytracer][1].

The implementation is multithreaded, but unfortunately, MRI's GIL does
not allow for thread-level parallelism. It is recommended to run on
either [Rubinius][2] or [JRuby][3], which is an alternative Ruby
implentation that does support real threading.

## Prerequisites

  * Ruby 1.9+

## Usage

    $ ruby rubyrays.rb > rubyrays.ppm
    $ open rubyrays.ppm

There are three optional arguments: `width`, `height`, and `threads`.
